<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Elevator Pitch Generator web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are and what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that helps pitch your idea and learn a little bit about coding.

You could make web presentations the easy way by creating a pdf's or powerpoint, or you could do a little more work to better understand these digital tools that you use everyday to (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand our tools and how they work.

In this file, you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you say something meaningful about almost anything. While the Greeks originally used it to help them explore questions and issues, and to try to figure out where others might disagree on those issues, the design can easily be adapted to other ends like this one. You should even commit this exercise of stasis to memory. That way, if you are ever stuck on an elevator with someone important...you'll be ready to have something to say. That was indeed the problem for Archimedes, the engineer who built the first elevator in 236BC and afterwards found himself riding in his elevator with all kinds of powerful people, ascending and descending with nothing to say. And for almost two hundred years, the the problem continued to plague the Greeks until the rhetorician Hermagoras solved this communication problem by developing the questions of stasis. Some say it was actually Aristotle, some hundred years pre-elevator, who first theorized the questions of stasis. And much later in the Roman period, Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal of stasis is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop only long enough in time/space to assess how we got where we are and what happened before moving forward. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.)

To get started with the Elevator Pitch Generator, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.

If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

    <h2>CryptoTracker utilizes CoinGecko's API to display live price information on the digital coins that are currently trending. Users can add coins into a portfolio and view them on the separate "pins" page. All pinned coins are saved through browser cookies. CryptoTracker suppports over 7000 coins, which can be searched for by the user to add to their portfolio. Components on the website are dynamically rendered using JavaScript and styled with CSS. Our group initially wanted to use a front-end framework such as ReactJS, but after prototyping we decided it was easier to avoid it given our project's smaller scope. However, the code is written in such
      a way that migrating to a different front-end will not take a lot of time.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Eric, Stefon, and Julian wrote the code for the website while Charles worked on the frequently asked questions and documentation. Everyone contributed to the technical writing in places like the readme, this presentation, and the original pitch. All 3 of the programmers contributed to the JavaScript and CSS components. Julian handled the graphs for the coins as well as the individual coin pages. Eric worked on the
      cookies and provided the layout for the website display. Stefon implemented the API calls and the code to dynamically display each coin's information. Charles designed the FAQ in InDesign and finished the documentation for the project.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      Aside from the bi-weekly meetings in class, our group met every Sunday to evaluate or progress and decide what features needed to be worked on. Communication between meetings was done through Discord. We utilized a GitHub repository to collaborate on code asyncronously and a shared document to assign tasks/deadlines.

  <h1>Quality</h1>
    <h2>
      Current cryptocurrency price information is scattered to say the least. Many sites are convoluted and don't refresh price information in real time. CryptoTracker provides a simple interface with live updates, making it a one-stop tracking site.
    </h2>
     <h2>This product has a potential market of investors who want live information without the headache of manually keeping track of their portfolios. This website allows users to maintain a portfolio that automatically updates with current market data as well as a graph
       displaying some historical data. Having this much information consolidated into a single page better informs business decisions for users.

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

    <h2>Moving forward, our website might have to migrate to a different API or create infrastructure that allows for aggregation of data on all coins. One of the issues with using CoinGecko is that API calls are limited to 50 coins at a time. This caused issues when calculating the top 10
      most volatile coins, which led to us modifying the way coins are chosen for the home page. The current search feature on the website is not ideal, and would be one of the first improvements made given more time.
